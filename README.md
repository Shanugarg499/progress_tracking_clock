# progress_tracking_clock
This is a simple clock that opens with small window. Every time you complete a question, just mark done.

It'll show, your progress with percentage and progress bar. It'll also show time in format : " mm, ss "  You'll get the option to see report that shows, how long you took to solve questions (in minutes), ordered in order of questions.

This simple clock is idea generated from the video of William Lin : https://youtu.be/dZ_6MS14Mg4
